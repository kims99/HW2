		<div><p>I consider myself a non-traditional technical student...  I didn't grow up wondering how a computer worked, had someone to teach me the in and outs of a PC, or was interested in programming.  However, after taking the Information Systems course at Iowa, I was very interested in working with databases and everything that came along with it!  Feel free to explore my page to get know me more.</p></div>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Located in the southeastern part of Iowa with a city population of around 24,0000, I was born and raised in Ottumwa.  As a kid, I went to school, played outside with friends, played computer games, downloaded random viruses off the web, and did what every other normal kid would do.  I grew up with a family of four with my parents and a younger brother.  My parents, Tim and Anna, were born in Laos and moved over to the United States in the late '90s.  My brother, Austin, who is seven years younger than me, loves to game on his PC, eat spicy food, and learn new things.  Throughout my early education, I did academically well and was recognized for my hard work by being an honor roll student for many years.  But without the inspiration of my friend in the 6th grade, I would not have been motivated to push myself harder to be the best I can be.  After graduating high school, I continued to strive for the best both in my workplace and post-secondary education.
